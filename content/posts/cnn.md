Every gray scale image is a two-dimensional matrix of numbers, where each element, called a **pixel**, ranges from $0$ to $255$. Black pixels are encoded as $0$, and white pixels are encoded as $255$. Gray colored pixels fall between them.

<figure style="width: 400px">
	<img src="/media/vision/grayscale-number.gif" alt="Grayscale Number">
	<figcaption>Grayscale Number</figcaption>
</figure>

Pixels are usually normalized into the range $0$ to $1$ by dividing each by $255$.
