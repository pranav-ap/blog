The **Central Limit Theorem** states that the sample mean $\overline{x}$ of a large number of samples from a population will approximately be normally distributed, regardless of the type of the population distribution.

Consider the following experiment,

1. Roll a die $20$ times and count the number of heads
2. Note down the sample mean
3. Repeat this multiple times

As this experiment is repeated, ie. the more samples we take, the graph showing the sample means will increasingly look normal.
